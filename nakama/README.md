# Nakama Godot Tutorial Demo

This directory contains the simplest server-side code to get your authoritative server started.

The module `modules/world_control.lua` defines the required functions to set up an authoritative multiplayer server architecture and manage matches. `modules/world_rpc.lua` defines one remote procedure call (RPC) to allow clients to join the same match.

For more information, read the Nakama documentation on [authoritative multiplayer](https://heroiclabs.com/docs/gameplay-multiplayer-server-multiplayer/).
